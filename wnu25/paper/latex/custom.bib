abstract = {Long before computer games became popular recreations, mathematicians viewed games as models of decision making. The general understanding of decisions, however, has been impeded by the ambiguity of some of the basic components of game-tree search. In particular, the static evaluation function, or determination of a node's merit based on directly detectable features, has never been adequately defined. The expected-outcome model proposes that the appropriate value to assign a node is the expected value of a game's outcome given random play from that node on. This proposal is supported by both analytic proofs and experimental evidence: the model's optimality on a class of simple game-trees is derived analytically, and the popular statistical techniques of random sampling and regression analysis produce efficient expected-outcome estimators in real games. Overall, the expected-outcome model of two-player games is shown to be precise, accurate, easily estimable, efficiently calculable, and domain-independent.},

abstract = {The creation of high quality interactive dramas requires both expertise in authoring (compelling plot arcs, dialog, character conflicts, etc.) and technical expertise in computational and generative story representations. Currently, authors, or more typically author teams, must have competence in programming, a background in artificial intelligence, competence in interaction and game design, and skill in story authoring, including the creation of compelling plot spaces (potential plots), rich characters, and believable dialog. Even for experts, the necessity of bringing all these skills to bear can make the authoring of complete interactive drama experiences a heroic undertaking; for novices, the creation of such experiences is out of the question. The interactive drama Fa\c{c}ade [7], for example, uses over 200,000 lines of behavior code to represent a 30-minute dynamic player experience. In addition to relegating interactive drama authoring to a small group of experts, these requirements limit the exploration of the potential design space of interactive dramas and slow the adoption of these technologies in the game industry, which stands to benefit from meaningful social interactions and dynamic story spaces that are much larger than any that could be realistically hand-authored.},

abstract = {The generation of extended plots for melodramatic fiction is an interesting task for Artificial Intelligence research, one that requires the application of generalization techniques to carry out fully. UNIVERSE is a story-telling program that uses plan-like units, ‘plot fragments’, to generate plot outlines. By using a rich library of plot fragments and a well-developed set of characters, UNIVERSE can create a wide range of plot outlines. In this paper we illustrate how UNIVERSE's plot fragment library is used to create plot outlines and how it might be automatically extended using explanation-based generalization methods. Our methods are based on analysis of a television melodrama, including comparisons of similar stories.}

We improve visual story generation by producing a new image-grounded dataset, Visual Writing Prompts (VWP). VWP contains almost 2K selected sequences of movie shots, each including 5-10 images. The image sequences are aligned with a total of 12K stories which were collected via crowdsourcing given the image sequences and a set of grounded characters from the corresponding image sequence. Our new image sequence collection and filtering process has allowed us to obtain stories that are more coherent, diverse, and visually grounded compared to previous work. We also propose a character-based story generation model driven by coherence as a strong baseline. Evaluations show that our generated stories are more coherent, visually grounded, and diverse than stories generated with the current state-of-the-art model. Our code, image features, annotations and collected stories are available at https://vwprompt.github.io/.},

    abstract = "Systems for story generation are asked to produce plausible and enjoyable stories given an input context. This task is underspecified, as a vast number of diverse stories can originate from a single input. The large output space makes it difficult to build and evaluate story generation models, as (1) existing datasets lack rich enough contexts to meaningfully guide models, and (2) existing evaluations (both crowdsourced and automatic) are unreliable for assessing long-form creative text. To address these issues, we introduce a dataset and evaluation platform built from STORIUM, an online collaborative storytelling community. Our author-generated dataset contains 6K lengthy stories (125M tokens) with fine-grained natural language annotations (e.g., character goals and attributes) interspersed throughout each narrative, forming a robust source for guiding models. We evaluate language models fine-tuned on our dataset by integrating them onto STORIUM, where real authors can query a model for suggested story continuations and then edit them. Automatic metrics computed over these edits correlate well with both user ratings of generated stories and qualitative feedback from semi-structured user interviews. We release both the STORIUM dataset and evaluation platform to spur more principled research into story generation."

Using neural language models which combine character and action descriptions from these stories, we show that we can learn the latent ties. Action sequences are better predicted when the character performing the action is also taken into account, and vice versa for character attributes."

Despite considerable efforts on automatic story generation in the past, prior work either is restricted in plot planning, or can only generate stories in a narrow domain. In this paper, we explore open-domain story generation that writes stories given a title (topic) as input. We propose a &lt;em&gt;plan-and-write&lt;/em&gt; hierarchical generation framework that first plans a storyline, and then generates a story based on the storyline. We compare two planning strategies. The &lt;em&gt;dynamic&lt;/em&gt; schema interweaves story planning and its surface realization in text, while the &lt;em&gt;static&lt;/em&gt; schema plans out the entire storyline before generating stories.

However, existing automatic metrics are observed to correlate poorly with human evaluation. The lack of standardized benchmark datasets makes it difficult to fully evaluate the capabilities of a metric and fairly compare different metrics. Therefore, we propose OpenMEVA, a benchmark for evaluating open-ended story generation metrics. OpenMEVA provides a comprehensive test suite to assess the capabilities of metrics, including (a) the correlation with human judgments, (b) the generalization to different model outputs and datasets, (c) the ability to judge story coherence, and (d) the robustness to perturbations. To this end, OpenMEVA includes both manually annotated stories and auto-constructed test examples. We evaluate existing metrics on OpenMEVA and observe that they have poor correlation with human judgments, fail to recognize discourse-level incoherence, and lack inferential knowledge (e.g., causal order between events), the generalization ability and robustness. Our study presents insights for developing NLG models and metrics in further research."
